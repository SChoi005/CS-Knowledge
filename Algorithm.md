# Algorithm

## Introduction
### Algorithm
* Describe procedure solving problem.
* Problem requirements
  * Explicit as input and output.
  * Algorithm describes procedure making output from input  

#### Desirable Algorithm
* Clearly
* Efficiently

### Evaluation criteria for algorithms
1. Correctness
2. Amout of work done
   * Executed time of Algorithm
3. Memory space used 
4. Simplicity, Clarity
   * If algorithm is simple and clear, it is easy to write program or revise
5. Optimality
   * There is no better alogrithm than this for the problem

### Describing Language for Algorithm 
* <strong>pseudo-language</strong> => Language for describing algorithm
* <strong>pseudo-code</strong> => Code written by pseudo-language
