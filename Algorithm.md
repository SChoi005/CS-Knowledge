# Algorithm

## Introduction
### Algorithm
* Describe procedure solving problem.
* Problem requirements
  * Explicit as input and output.
  * Algorithm describes procedure making output from input  

#### Desirable Algorithm
* Clearly
* Efficiently

### Evaluation criteria for algorithms
1. Correctness
2. Amout of work done
  * Execute time of Algorithm
3. Memory space used 
  * If algorithm is simple and clear, it is easy to write program or revise
5. Simplicity, Clarity
6. Optimality
