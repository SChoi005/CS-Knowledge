# Object-Oriented Programming

## Class Name
> By convention, class names start with an uppercase letter. <br/>
> Capitalize the first letter of each word in the name. ex) ComputeExpression

## Named Constants
> Capitalize all letters in constants, and use underscores to connect words.

```java
  final datatype CONSTANT_NAME = VALUE;
```

## Variables and method names
> Use lowercase for the first word.<br/>
> Capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word in the name.

## Software Development Process

### 1. Requirement Specification
> A process that seeks to understand the problem and document in detail what the software system needs to do.
> This phase involves close interaction between users and designers.
### 2. System Analysis
> Seeks to analyze the business process in terms of data flow, and to identify the system's input and output.
> Part of the analysis entails modeling the system's behavior. 
> The model is intended to capture the essential elements of the system and to define services to the system.
### 3. System Design
> The process of designing the system's component
> This phase involves the use of many levels of abstraction to decompose the problem into manageable components, identify classes and interfaces, and establish relationships among the classes and interfaces.
#### IPO
> The essence of system analysis and design is input, process, and output. This is called IPO.
### 4. Implementation
> The process of translating the system design into programs.
> Seperate programs are written for each component and put to work together.
> The implementation involves coding, testing, and debugging.
### 5. Testing
> Ensures that the code meets the requirements specification and weeds out bugs.
### 6. Deployment
> Deployment makes the project available for use. For a java program, this means installing it on a desktop or on the Web.
### 7. Maintenance
> This requires periodic upgrades of the product to fix newly discovered bugs and incorporate changes.
