# Open Source SW

## The Beginnings of Free and Open Source Software

### Early Software
* 1940s ~ 1970s 
  * Develope driven by universities or company labs. e.g., MIT, AT&T Bell Labs
  * Openness and Collaboration culture
  * "Software is a tool to use hardware.
  * System users in person make software and share that.

### UNIX
* The beginning in Bell Labs in 1969.
* Version 4 - rewritten in C (1973)
  * Disappear need to produce OS for each hardware - The First Portable OS
* Version 6 (1975)
  * Start licensing for universities and companies.
  * Restrict "software as a business" due to US government antitrust
* UNIX SYSTEM V (1983)
  * Commercialization of UNIX -> UNIX WARS

### PC (1980s)
* Market domination of IBM hardware & Microsoft OS
  * not need source code due to standardized PC system structure. 
* Shareware
  * software that is distributed free on a trial basis with the understanding that the user may need or want to pay for it later.
  * "Try before you buy"
  * not Open Source

### Disruption of Hacker Culture
* MIT AI Lab
  * "Pure hacker paradise"
  * US Copyright Act of 1976
    * Program productor stop providing source code
  * Lisp Progrmming Language
    * Commercialization (1979)
    * Symbolics vs Lisp Machin Inc. War

### GNU
* By Richard Stallman (1983)
  * Unix-compatible
  * A world where can be lived even with free software
* GNU Public License (GPL, 1989)
  * In case of distribution by revising GPL program, must release source code.
  * Copyleft, reciprocal licence

### Server OS competition : Unix vs. Windows
* In past, produce OS specified various hardware
* As become standardizing hardware as Intel x86 architecture, occur competition for domination for os market
* Microsoft
  * OS/2 with IBM (1985) : fail due to opinion difference with IBM
  * Windows NT (1993) : Due to convenience of installation and using, be more competitive

### Internet Age

* World Wide Web (1990)
  * popularization of Internet
* Distributed computing trend
  * One large System (scale-up) -> Many small systems (scale-out)   
* OS for Internet Servers
  * Researchers and DIY users prefer modularity of unix
  * Declination other OS like BSD UNIX.
  * New Challenger : LINUX

### LINUX
* Linus Torvalds, Finland undergraduate student, start as hobby.
* Unix-like OS based on the Linux kernel, GPL licenced
  * Free download, UNIX program and skills compatible
  * Explosive growth by getting popularity for students, research institute.
* Advent of Internet companies (Google, Amazon, Facebook)
  * prefer software that can be customization as low price
  * Open source is best

### Distruptive Innovation
> By developing and starting from providing technologies for Low-end customers, process that pushes existed competitors that are in high-end.<br/>

### 21 century open source
* Ecosystem suitable for innovation
  * Cloud computing, big data, containers, AI
  * e.g. Hadoop MapReduce + Apache Spark + Ceph
* Destruction of Software Monolith
  * Minimaize License fee, installation cost and tying 
* Distributed and flexible computing landscape
  * Mix and match
  * Focus on implementation than Standard setting
